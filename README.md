# NFT-collection-whitelist-dapp
Supponing you are launching your NFT collection, you want to give your early supporters access to a whitelist for your collection. This is a demo project to learn the basics of web3.0 and dapp development based on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Smart Contract
The `Hardhat` development environment has been used and the smart contract `Whitelist` has been written in Solidity. It has been deployed on the `Goerli Testnet` and you can find it on the [Goerli Etherscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xc148F023c7d4518d4216fCbE9e7700997C04a6B4).

## Frontend
The client side application has been development in `NextJS/Javascript`, with `TailwindCSS` and `Flowbite` libraries. Moreover, `web3modal` and `ethers@5` libraries have been used for the connection to the Blockchain and the execution of the functionalities offered by the Whitelist Contract.
