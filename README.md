Supponing you are launching your NFT collection, you want to give your early supporters access to a whitelist for your collection and to provide several features to your users, such as an Initial Coin Offering, a DAO with proposals from NFT holders and an Exchange. This is a demo project to learn the basics of web3.0 and dapp development based on the Ethereum blockchain.

The `Hardhat` development environment has been used and the smart contracts have been written in Solidity. It has been deployed on the `Sepolia Testnet` and you can find their addresses [here](https://github.com/andrea-deluca/NFT-collection-whitelist-dapp/blob/main/hardhat/constants/index.js).

## Frontend
The client side application has been development in `NextJS/Javascript`, with `TailwindCSS` and `Flowbite` libraries. Moreover, `web3modal` and `ethers@5` libraries have been used for the connection to the Blockchain and the execution of the functionalities offered by the Whitelist Contract.
